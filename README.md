# Electronics Hardware Design Portfolio

This repository showcases a curated selection of my original electronics hardware designs. These projects span power electronics, RF systems, digital logic, and embedded hardware, each built with an emphasis on practical validation, clean design, and production-readiness.

## About Me

With over three years of hands-on experience, I specialize in taking ideas from concept to lab-verified prototypes. My approach blends solid engineering principles with detailed testing and manufacturing-aware design. I work across the full lifecycleâ€”from schematic capture and BOM optimization to PCB layout, fabrication, and real-world debugging.
